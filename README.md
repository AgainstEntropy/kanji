# Streaming Kanji

This projects aims to build a novel dialogue system. 

Users are not talking to a common ChatBot in English, but in a kanji-like novel language, where responses are rendered with Diffusion-based models.

Thanks to the StreamDiffusion pipeline, the system can stream character-level images, just like a normal dialog stream.

## Deploy the System

TBC.


## Reproduce

Check out the [guide](./docs/REPRODUCE.md) on reproducing all components of this system.
